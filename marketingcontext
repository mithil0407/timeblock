**ICONIK Ad Hooks Library:**

​​**PART 1: THE AD CREATION SYSTEM**

**FRAMEWORK: THE 3-LAYER CREATIVE STACK**

Think of every ad as having 3 components that can be independently
tested:

HOOK (First 3 seconds) →BODY (Proof mechanism) →CTA (Offer clarity)

Your job is to **systematize each layer** so you\'re not starting from
scratch every time.

**LAYER 1: HOOK BANK (12 Core Templates)**

Stop improvising hooks. Build a **reusable hook library** based on
proven psychological triggers. Here are your 12:

  **1. Contrarian Advice**        \"They told you \[common advice\], but that\'s terrible if you \[pain point\]\"                           \"They told you to tuck in your shirt to look polished---but that\'s terrible advice if you have a tummy.\"
                                                                                                                                            
  **2. Pattern Interrupt**        \"Stop \[doing X\]. Here\'s what \[authority figure\] does instead.\"                                     \"Stop wearing A-line kurtas to hide your waist. Here\'s what stylists do for apple-shaped women.\"
                                                                                                                                            
  **3. Transformation Tease**     \"\[Name\] used to \[pain\]. Now she \[dream outcome\]. Here\'s how.\"                                    \"Priya used to avoid fitted clothes. Now she wears structured blazers to client meetings. Here\'s the science.\"

They highlight your tummy. You still feel bulky. Here\'s why.\"
                                                                                                                                            
  **5. Authority Credibility**    \"After styling \[X\] women with \[pain\], I\'ve learned \[insight\].\"                                   \"After styling 300+ apple-shaped women, I\'ve learned empire cuts do more harm than good.\"
                                                                                                                                            
  **6. Myth-Busting**             \"The fashion industry lied to you about \[X\]. Here\'s the truth.\"                                      \"The fashion industry lied about \'dressing for your body type.\' Here\'s what actually works.\"
                                                                                                                                            
  **7. Urgency Framing**          \"If you\'re \[age/life stage\], you have \[timeframe\] to fix this before \[consequence\].\"             \"If you\'re 35+, you have 5 years before your wardrobe makes you invisible at work.\"
                                                                                                                                            
  **8. Social Proof Opener**      \"\[X\]% of women with \[pain\] make this mistake. Are you one of them?\"                                 \"87% of women with heavy arms wear sleeveless to \'feel confident.\' It backfires. Here\'s why.\"
                                                                                                                                            
  **9. Before/After Contrast**    \"\[Visual\]. Left = \[pain\]. Right = \[solution\]. The difference? \[insight\].\"                       \"Left: Flowy kurta. Right: Structured kurta. The difference? Vertical seams.\"
                                                                                                                                            
  **10. Problem Stacking**        \"You have \[pain 1\]. And \[pain 2\]. And \[pain 3\]. They\'re all connected.\"                          \"You have a tummy. And short height. And modest dressing rules. They\'re all solvable with one system.\"
                                                                                                                                            
  **11. Insider Secret**          \"Stylists don\'t tell you this, but \[insight\].\"                                                       \"Stylists don\'t tell you this, but 80% of \'flattering\' advice is for Western body types.\"
                                                                                                                                            
  **12. Aspirational Identity**   \"Women who \[dream outcome\] don\'t \[common behavior\]. They \[new behavior\].\"                        \"Women who command respect in meetings don\'t wear flowy tops. They wear structured silhouettes.\"

**Your Action:** Pick 3-4 hook types per week. Rotate them. Track which
ones yield the lowest CPM/highest CTR.

**LAYER 2: BODY STRUCTURE (3 Proven Formulas)**

Once the hook stops the scroll, the **body** must justify the click. Use
these 3 frameworks:

**Formula A: Problem →Agitation →Science →Proof**

1\. \"Let\'s be honest: \[common pain\].\"

2\. \"You\'ve tried \[failed solution 1\], \[failed solution 2\]. You
still feel \[emotion\].\"

3\. \"Here\'s the science: \[insight about body type/color/fabric\].\"

4\. \"We styled \[name\]---her pain\]. We gave her \[solution\]. She
\[result\].\"

**Formula B: Authority →Insight →Case Study**

1\. \"After styling \[X\] women with \[pain\], I\'ve learned
\[counterintuitive insight\].\"

2\. \"The mistake? \[common behavior\].\"

3\. \"The fix? \[specific solution\].\"

4\. \"\[Name\] from \[city\]---her pain\]. Now she \[result\].\"

**Formula C: Myth-Busting →Reframe →Proof**

1\. \"The fashion industry says \[myth\].\"

2\. \"But if you\'re \[body type/age/lifestyle\], that\'s wrong. Here\'s
why: \[science\].\"

3\. \"We proved it with \[name\]. \[Her transformation\].\"

**Your Action:** Every ad must follow one of these 3 formulas. No
exceptions.

**LAYER 3: CTA ARCHITECTURE (Offer Clarity + Scarcity)**

Your CTA has 3 jobs:

1.  **Clarify the offer** (What they get for ₹999).

2.  **Remove friction** (Why it\'s risk-free).

3.  **Create urgency** (Why they must act now).

**Template:**

\"₹999. \[What they get\]. \[Scarcity trigger\]. \[Link/CTA\].\"

**Examples:**

-   \"₹999. Your personalized Blueprint + 1-hour styling call. 8 slots
    left this week. Link below.\"

-   \"₹999. 16 looks tailored to your body type and lifestyle. Next
    batch starts Monday. Book now.\"

**PART 2: THE TESTING SYSTEM**

**THE 3x3x3 TESTING MATRIX**

You can\'t test everything at once. Use this hierarchy:

PHASE 1: Hook Testing (Week 1-2)

→Test 3 hooks with the same body + CTA.

→Winner = lowest CPM + highest CTR (\>2%).

PHASE 2: Body Testing (Week 3-4)

→Test 3 body formulas with the winning hook.

→Winner = highest landing page CTR.

PHASE 3: Offer Testing (Week 5-6)

→Test 3 CTA variations with the winning hook + body.

→Winner = lowest CAC + highest conversion rate.

**Example Week 1:**

-   Ad 1: Contrarian Hook + Formula A + Standard CTA

-   Ad 2: Pain Amplification Hook + Formula A + Standard CTA

-   Ad 3: Transformation Hook + Formula A + Standard CTA

**Budget Allocation:** ₹00/day per ad for 3 days. Kill losers on Day 4.
Scale winner to ₹000/day.

EXAMPLE OF WHAT HAS WORKED:

\
They told you to tuck in your shirt to look polished but thats terrible
advice if you have a tummy.Let\'s be honest: High-waisted jeans? They
roll down. Belted dresses? They highlight exactly what you wanted to
hide. So you wear long, flowy tops. You avoid bodycon anything. You
layer to \'create balance.\' But you still feel bulky. Like nothing
flatters you.Here\'s the science: If you\'re apple-shaped with a heavier
midsection---empire cuts and A-line silhouettes skim your stomach
without adding volume.. If you\'re rectangle-shaped---structured jackets
and vertical panels create a waist without cinching. Pair that with
darker tones in your undertone palette? You look streamlined. Not
stuffed. We styled Kavita---a marketing manager from Hyderabad. She
avoided fitted anything. We gave her 16 looks. Peplum tops. Straight
kurtas. Structured co-ords.. She stopped hiding. Started showing up\...
